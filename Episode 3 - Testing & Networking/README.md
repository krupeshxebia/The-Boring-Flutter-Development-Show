# The Boring Flutter Development Show [Episode 3]

In this episode we completed autogenerating of our abstract class and serialization methods<br>
We did network testing for both : list of ids and fetching articles <br>
Then we wrapped up by adding few articles using Future builder to our app UI. <br>

PS (We missed Philip in this episode!)


Below is the command to run the immutable class and serializer builder
```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```
